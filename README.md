# Chip-8 Emulator

#### A simple emulator utilizing SDL2.

Can (not at the moment, but soon will) run Chip-8 files by reading bytes into memory array and emulating the Chip-8's CPU opcodes.

I would like to thank **Laurence Muller** and his article at https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/ for the inspiration (and some bits and pieces of code for the project) to give me the opportunity to learn about emulation in the first place.
