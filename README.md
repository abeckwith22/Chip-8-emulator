# Chip-8 Emulator

Simple Emulator utilizing SDL2.

Can (not at the moment, but soon will) run Chip-8 files by reading bytes into memory array and emulating the Chip-8's CPU opcodes.

I would like to thank Laurence Muller and his article at https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/ for the inspiration (and some bits and pieces of code for the project) to give me the opportunity to learn about emulation in the first place.

This project is for educative purposes and what I found to be a fun little project.
